# ece3220_final
ECE 3220 Final Project for Joel Abshier, Kyle Deppe, and Tsiania Hughes

This program was originally made to run on Visual Studio, however it was altered to be compatible with Eclipse. All that should need to be done to run it is compile->run on Eclipse.
Run the game in the terminal for the best gaming experience.
